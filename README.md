spring-social-appdotnet
=======================

spring social implementation for app.net API

for a simple usage example see https://github.com/arikg/spring-social-appdotnet-example/

Project Status
---------------
26.08.2012: The project is in early development. 
App.net API itself is in early development as well and there is no api there that's defined as version 1 yet. So there will be compatability breaking changes in model structure and operations.
There are currently 3 operations that are working well with the current api version: 
* PostsOperations
* UserOperations
* TokenOperations
